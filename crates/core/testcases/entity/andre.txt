==Professional career==

===1986–1993: Breakthrough and the first major title===
[[File:Agassi in argentina.jpg|thumb|Agassi when he played the Davis Cup Americas zone in Buenos Aires, 1988]]
Agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at [[La Quinta, California]]. He won his first match against [[John Austin (tennis)|John Austin]], but then lost his second match to [[Mats Wilander]]. By the end of 1986, Agassi was ranked No. 91.<ref name="Tennis28">{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html |title=Tennis28-Bio:Andre Agassi |access-date=June 12, 2009 |publisher=Tennis28}}</ref> He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the [[ATP Itaparica|Sul American Open]] in [[Itaparica]]<ref name="greatath" /> and ended the year ranked No. 25.<ref name="greatath" /> He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, [[1988 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]], [[World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988|Forest Hills WCT]], Stuttgart Outdoor, [[1988 Volvo International|Volvo International]] and [[1988 Livingston Open|Livingston Open]]),<ref name="greatath" /> and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1&nbsp;million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152468/bio|title=Andre Agassi|publisher=IMDb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Andre Agassi |url=https://www.athletespeakers.com/speaker/andre-agassi |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=Celebrity Speakers For Speaking Engagements {{!}} AthleteSpeakers |language=en}}</ref> During 1988, he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager (a record that stood for 17 years until [[Rafael Nadal]] broke it in 2005).<ref>{{cite news |title=Teen Nadal gives Spain reign over French Open |date=June 5, 2006 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/french/2005-06-05-day-14_x.htm |agency=Associated Press (USA Today) |access-date=April 6, 2010}}</ref> His year-end ranking was No. 3, behind second-ranked [[Ivan Lendl]] and top-ranked [[Mats Wilander]]. Both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and ''Tennis'' magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.<ref name="greatath" />

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] from 1988 through 1990 (although he first played there in 1987, only to lose in the first round to [[Henri Leconte]]) and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-10 |title=Agassi hated Wimbledon dress code so much he boycotted it for three years |url=https://talksport.com/sport/tennis/1147060/andre-agassi-boycott-wimbledon-dress-code-white/ |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=talkSPORT |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-06-30 |title=Against the all-white rule at Wimbledon |url=https://lifestyle.livemint.com//news/talking-point/against-the-all-white-rule-at-wimbledon-111646993830455.html |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=Mintlounge |language=en}}</ref>

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1988 and made the US Open semi-finals in 1989. He began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to [[Andrés Gómez]], which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.essentiallysports.com/andre-agassi-says-he-lost-a-grand-slam-final-because-of-his-wig-tennis-news/ |title=Andre Agassi Says He Lost A Grand Slam Final Because Of His Wig |work=Essentially Sports |date=April 15, 2020 |access-date=June 27, 2021 }}</ref> He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was [[Pete Sampras]]; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.<ref name="greatath" /> The [[Agassi-Sampras rivalry]] became the biggest one in tennis over the rest of the decade. Agassi ended 1990 on a high note as he helped the United States win its first [[Davis Cup]] in 8 years on home soil against Australia (3-2) and won his only [[Tennis Masters Cup]], beating reigning Wimbledon champion [[Stefan Edberg]] in the final.

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final. The Las Vegan was a set and 3-1 up when came the rain. The rain delay proved to be a confidence builder for Courier. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-06-28/sports/1991179074_1_wimbledon-agassi-centre-court |title=Agassi makes a big splash in white on Centre Court |date=June 28, 1991 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to [[David Wheaton]].

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five-set final.<ref name="greatath" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/06/sports/tennis-on-the-grass-at-wimbledon-agassi-finally-hits-pay-dirt.html |title=On the Grass at Wimbledon, Agassi Finally Hits Pay Dirt |date=July 6, 1992 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: [[Boris Becker]] and [[John McEnroe]]. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until [[Lleyton Hewitt]] ten years later. Agassi was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years. Agassi famously played the game wearing [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] brand sunglasses, and a photo of him from the day appeared on the cover of [[Tennis (magazine)|''Tennis'' magazine]]. In his memoir, he wrote that he was covering up bloodshot eyes from a [[hangover]] and claimed that the founder of Oakley, [[Jim Jannard]], had sent him a [[Dodge Viper]] to thank him for the inadvertent publicity.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Chrisman-Campbell |first=Kimberly |title=Worn on This Day: the Clothes That Made History |year=2019 |publisher=Running Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t4WLDwAAQBAJ&q=agassi |isbn=978-0-7624-9357-9 |location=Philadelphia |page=30 |oclc=1089571878 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In 1993, Agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], partnered with [[Petr Korda]]. He missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and No. 1 Pete Sampras in five sets. Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to [[Thomas Enqvist]] and required wrist surgery late in the year.

===1994–1997: Rise to the top, Olympic Gold and the fall===
With new coach [[Brad Gilbert]] on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]]. His comeback culminated at the [[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994 US Open]] with a five-set fourth-round victory against [[Michael Chang]]. He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an [[Seed (tennis)|unseeded]] player, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final.<ref name="greatath" /> Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old "image is everything" style. He competed in the [[1995 Australian Open]] (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating defending champion Sampras in a four-set final.<ref name="greatath" /> Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ([[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], [[Miami Masters|Key Biscayne]], and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.<ref name="greatath" /> He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late-night four-set semi-final of the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] against [[Boris Becker]]. The streak ended the next day when Agassi lost the final to Sampras. Agassi admitted this loss, which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their head-to-head meetings, took two years for him to get over mentally.<ref name="tennis-buzz1995">{{cite web |url=https://tennis-buzz.com/1995-us-open-pete-sampras-defeats-andre-agassi/ |title=1995 US Open: Pete Sampras defeats Andre Agassi |publisher=Tennis Buzz |date=August 31, 2015 |accessdate=2022-07-19 |archive-date=August 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220818223454/http://tennis-buzz.com/1995-us-open-pete-sampras-defeats-andre-agassi/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Agassi reached the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|world No. 1]] ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. Agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked No. 1 at the year-end ranking. In terms of win–loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year. He won 73 and lost 9 matches, and was also once again a key player on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of his career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early-round losses to [[Chris Woodruff]] and [[Doug Flach]] at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi-finals. At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final. The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of Spain in the final.<ref name="greatath" /> Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He later confessed that he started using [[methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]] at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.<ref name="sports.espn.go.com">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4600027 |title=Andre Agassi book says he used crystal meth |work=[[ESPN]] |date=October 27, 2009 |access-date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink.

''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.

===1998–2003: Return to glory and Career Super Slam===
[[File:Andre Agassi 1999.jpg|thumb|Agassi in 1999]]
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Patrick Rafter]].

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from No. 110 to No. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.<ref name="atpbio">{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/en/players/andre-agassi/a092/overview |title=Andre Agassi player profile |website=Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) |access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to [[Tommy Haas]]. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the [[Miami Masters|Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne]], losing to [[Marcelo Ríos]], who became No. 1 as a result. At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat [[Andrei Medvedev (tennis)|Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining [[Rod Laver]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Don Budge]]—these have since been joined by [[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], and [[Novak Djokovic]]) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career. Only Laver, Agassi, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have achieved this feat during the [[Open Era]]. This win also made him the first (of only four, the next being Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts).  Agassi also became the only male player to win the [[Career Super Slam]], consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a [[ATP World Tour Finals|Year-end championship]].<ref name="SI" />

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.<ref name="greatath" /> He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final. Overall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the ATP Masters Series in Paris, where he beat [[Marat Safin]]. Agassi ended 1999 as the No. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–98).<ref name="greatath" /> This was the only time Agassi ended the year at No. 1.  Agassi was runner-up to Sampras at the year-end [[1999 Tennis Masters Cup|Tennis Masters Cup]] losing 1–6, 5–7, 4–6 despite beating Sampras in the round-robin 6–2, 6–2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tennismajors.com/our-features/november-28-1999-the-day-pete-sampras-won-the-atp-finals-for-the-fifth-time-310165.html |title=November 28, 1999: The day Pete Sampras won the ATP Finals for the fifth time |website=Tennis Majors |last=Sokolowski |first=Alexandre |date=November 28, 2020 |access-date=June 27, 2021 }}</ref>

He began the next year 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semi-final and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final.<ref name="greatath" /> He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.{{#tag:ref|[[Roger Federer]] has since surpassed this feat, reaching ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005 to 2007.|group=lower-alpha}}  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.{{#tag:ref|[[Pete Sampras]] held the 1993 Wimbledon, [[1993 US Open (tennis)|1993 US Open]] and [[1994 Australian Open]] titles simultaneously.

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Guardian Staff |date=2002-01-14 |title=Injured Agassi and Williams forced out |url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/jan/14/australianopen2002.australianopen2 |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> Agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his [[Key Biscayne]] title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final.

The match was the last of Sampras's career. Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, [[Rome Masters|Rome]] and [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.<ref name="atpbio" />

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ESPN.com - Australian Open 2003 - Agassi earns eighth Grand Slam title |url=https://www.espn.com/tennis/aus03/s/2003/0125/1499001.html |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=www.espn.com}}</ref>

On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the No. 1 ranking to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. The record was later surpassed by [[Roger Federer]] in 2018. He had held the No. 1 ranking for two weeks, when [[Lleyton Hewitt]] took it back on May 12, 2003. Agassi then recaptured the No. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003. There he managed to reach the US Open semi-finals, where he lost to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]], surrendering his No. 1 ranking to him. During his career, Agassi held the ranking for a total of 101 weeks. Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from a number of events. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer, his third time to finish as runner-up in the event after losses in 1999 and 2000, and finished the year ranked No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/946191-atp-world-tour-finals-counting-down-the-all-time-top-ten-champions |title=ATP World Tour Finals: Counting Down the All-Time Top 10 Champions |work=Bleacher Report |last=Allen |first=Ja |date=November 18, 2011 |access-date=June 27, 2021 }}</ref> At age 33, he had been one of the oldest players to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was No. 4 in 1987.<ref name="atpbio" />

===2004–2006: Final years===
[[file:Andre Agassi Indian Wells 2006.jpg|thumb|Agassi in 2006]]
In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semi-finals of the Australian Open to [[Marat Safin]]; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event. He won the [[Cincinnati Masters|Masters series event in Cincinnati]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), tied with Roger Federer and surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]], who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked No. 8, one of the oldest players to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was No. 7 in 1988.<ref name="atpbio" /> At the time, Agassi also became the sixth male player during the [[Tennis open era|open era]] to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over [[Alex Bogomolov]] in [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles.

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]], before falling to No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]].

Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating [[Răzvan Sabău]] and [[Ivo Karlović]] in straight sets and [[Tomáš Berdych]] in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], where he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker. His other five-set victories were over [[Xavier Malisse]] in the fourth round and [[Robby Ginepri]] in the semi-finals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets. Agassi finished 2005 ranked No. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.

Agassi had a poor start to 2006, as he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time. Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then [[2006 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles|Wimbledon]]. He was defeated in the third round by world No. 2 (and eventual runner-up) [[Rafael Nadal]]. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |title=Upsetting day: Agassi, then Roddick ousted |date=June 1, 2006 |access-date=October 27, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105214848/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |archive-date=November 5, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open. Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles to [[Fernando González]] of Chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a four-set win against [[Andrei Pavel]], Agassi faced eighth-seeded [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in the second round who had earlier advanced to the [[2006 Australian Open]] final and Wimbledon semi-finals.

==Rivalries==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2019}}

===Agassi vs. Sampras===
{{Main|Agassi–Sampras rivalry}}

The rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 1990s, as [[Pete Sampras|Sampras]] and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade. They also had very contrasting playing styles, with Sampras being considered the greatest [[serve (tennis)|server]] and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time. Agassi and Sampras met 34 times on the tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atptour.com/en/players/atp-head-2-head/andre-agassi-vs-pete-sampras/A092/S402 |title=Sampras-Agassi Head-to-Head Matches |work=Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)  |access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref>

The [[1990 U.S. Open (tennis)|1990 US Open]] was their first meeting in a Grand Slam tournament final. Agassi was favored as he was ranked No. 4 at the time, compared to the No. 12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had defeated Sampras in their only previously completed match. Agassi, however, lost the final to Sampras in straight sets. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the [[1992 French Open]], where they met in the quarterfinals. Although Sampras was ranked higher, Agassi came out winning in straight sets. They met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No. 1. Agassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole, levelling the match at two sets apiece; however, Sampras prevailed in five sets, and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship.

With both Sampras and Agassi participating, the [[USA Davis Cup team|US]] won the Davis Cup in 1995. The year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles, meeting each other twice in the finals, and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year. They met five times during the year, all in the title matches, including the [[1995 Australian Open|Australian Open]], the [[Indian Wells Masters|Newsweek Champions Cup]] (now Indian Wells), the [[Lipton International Players Championships]] (now Miami Open), the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]], and the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Agassi won three of the finals, including the Australian Open; however, Sampras took the US Open title, ending Agassi's 26-match winning streak. After Agassi had taken most of the fall season off, Sampras took over the No. 1 ranking for the end of the season. Agassi admitted this loss, which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their head-to-head meetings, took two years for him to get over it mentally.<ref name="tennis-buzz1995"/>

In the following three years, while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles every season, Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions. The next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in 1999, where Sampras won in straight sets. For both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open. Sampras forfeited the No. 1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that year's US Open, which Agassi went on to win. They faced each other twice in the season-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup|ATP Tour World Championships]], with Sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.

In the 2000s, they met three more times on the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests. In 2000, the top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] in five sets, which was an important win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against Sampras. In arguably their most memorable match ever, Sampras defeated Agassi in the [[2001 U.S. Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] quarterfinals in four sets. There were no breaks of serve during the entire match. Reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during US Open rain delays, and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players.

Their last meeting was the final of the [[2002 U.S. Open (tennis)|2002 US Open]], which was their third meeting in a US Open final, but the first since 1995. The match was also notable because they had defeated several up-and-coming players en route to the final. Sampras had defeated No. 3 [[Tommy Haas]] in the fourth round and future No. 1 [[Andy Roddick]] in the quarterfinals, while Agassi had defeated No. 1 and defending champion [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the semi-finals. Sampras defeated Agassi in four sets. This was the final [[ATP tour]] singles match of Sampras's career.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Muir |first=Allan |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2002/us_open/news/2002/09/07/agassi_hewitt/ |title=Breaking news, real-time scores and daily analysis from Sports Illustrated – SI.com |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101220644/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2002/us_open/news/2002/09/07/agassi_hewitt/ |archive-date=November 1, 2002 }}</ref>

===Agassi vs. Chang===
[[Michael Chang]] was the opponent Agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than Sampras. They met 22 times on the tour level with Agassi leading 15–7. Chang, unlike most of Agassi's big rivals, had a playing style similar to his. Both players preferred to stay at the baseline with Chang being more defensive-minded. The outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies. The rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of American tennis players and both being of foreign descent.

Agassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 US Open and defeating Chang, the defending champion, in the 1990 French Open in a four-set quarterfinal. Arguably their best match took place in the round of 16 of the 1994 US Open. While both players presented high-quality shot-making, the momentum changed from set to set with Agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory. It turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first US Open title. Their next two Grand Slam meetings came in 1996, with Chang recording easy straight-set victories in the semi-finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open. Years after, Agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker, who was awaiting the winner in the final. Agassi won the last four of their matches, with the last being in 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly past his prime.

===Agassi vs. Becker===
[[Boris Becker]] and Agassi played 14 times with Agassi leading 10–4. Becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990, and won 10 of their last 11 matches. One contributing factor is that after their third match, Agassi picked up a tell regarding Becker's serve and knew where his serves would be directed.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://money.yahoo.com/tennis-legend-andre-agassi-revealed-195432658.html | title=Tennis legend Andre Agassi revealed that he learned how to beat a rival by watching his tongue on serves | date=April 29, 2021 }}</ref> They first played at Indian Wells in 1988, with Becker prevailing. Their most notable match was the 1989 [[Davis Cup]] semi-final match, which Becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks. Agassi, considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass, shocked Becker, a three-time champion, in a five-set quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first Grand Slam title. The intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995. Becker won that year's Wimbledon semi-final after being down a set and two breaks, to eventually win in four sets. In a highly anticipated rematch in the US Open semi-final, this time it was Agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets. Their final match was played at Hong Kong in 1999, which Agassi won in three sets.

===Agassi vs. Rafter===
Agassi and [[Pat Rafter]] played fifteen times with Agassi leading 10–5. The rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters, because of the players' contrasting styles of play, with Rafter using traditional serve-&-volley methods against Agassi's variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons. Agassi led 8–2 on hard courts, but Rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the [[1999 Italian Open (tennis)|1999 Rome Masters]]. They played four matches at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] with both winning two matches each. Agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999, while Rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters, the latter two matches being gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played. Agassi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open, in 1995 and 2001, on his way to the title on both occasions. Rafter, however, took their only US Open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title.

===Agassi vs. Federer===
Agassi and [[Roger Federer]] played 11 times, and Federer led their head-to-head series 8–3. With the retirement of Sampras, the rivalry against the 11-years-younger Federer, who was another great server like Sampras, became Agassi's main rivalry for the final years of his career. Agassi won their first three matches, but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones. They first met in just the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] and the finals of the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round-robin and the final. They played a quarterfinal match at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] that spanned over two windy days, with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final duel took place in the final of the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|2005 US Open]]. Federer was victorious in four sets in front of a pro-Agassi crowd. The match was the last appearance by Agassi in any tournament final.

===Agassi vs. Lendl===
Agassi and [[Ivan Lendl]] played eight times, and Lendl led their head-to-head series 6–2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/ivan-lendl-vs-andre-agassi/L018/A092|title=Ivan Lendl VS Andre Agassi &#124; Tennis|website=ATP Tour}}</ref>

===Agassi vs. Edberg===
Agassi and [[Stefan Edberg]] played nine times, and Agassi led their head-to-head series 6–3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/stefan-edberg-vs-andre-agassi/E004/A092|title=Stefan Edberg VS Andre Agassi &#124; Tennis|website=ATP Tour}}</ref>

==Earnings==
Agassi earned more than $30&nbsp;million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, Sampras and Murray to date (May 2018). He also earned more than $25&nbsp;million a year through endorsements during his career, which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/53/1YUQ.html |title=Forbes:Andre Agassi |work=Forbes |access-date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>

==Post-retirement==
Since retiring after the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. On September 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the [[Andy Roddick]]/[[Roger Federer]] [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarterfinal. He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with [[Tim Henman]] and [[Kim Clijsters]]. He played [[World Team Tennis]] for the [[Philadelphia Freedoms]] in the summer of 2009.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/02/26/agassi.ap/index.html Andre Agassi Will Play WTT] ''Sports Illustrated'', March 1, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026001825/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/02/26/agassi.ap/index.html |date=October 26, 2012 }}</ref> At the [[2009 French Open]], Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer, who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/07/roger-federer-wins-french-open |title=Roger Federer beats Robin Soderling to win French Open tennis |work=The Guardian |date=June 7, 2009 |access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but especially down the line. His forehand was nearly as strong, especially his inside-out to the ad court.<ref>{{cite web |author =Nick Bollettieri |url=http://www.tennisplayer.net/public/tour_strokes/nick_bollettieri/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand_images/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand.html?format=print |title=Building the Agassi Backhand |website=tennisplayer.net |access-date=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

Agassi's strength was in dictating play from the baseline, and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1783460-rafael-nadal-vs-andre-agassi-was-a-transition-of-tennis-generations|title=Rafael Nadal vs. Andre Agassi Was a Transition of Tennis Generations|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.<ref name="ReferenceA">Open: Andre Agassi HarpersCollins 2009</ref> When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> A signature play later in his career was a change-up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.

Agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> His strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.

==Business ventures==
Agassi established a [[limited liability company]] named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rogers-steps-down-as-agassi-enterprises-president/ |title=Rogers steps down as Agassi Enterprises president |newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal |date=October 16, 2008 |access-date=September 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512181941/https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rogers-steps-down-as-agassi-enterprises-president/ |archive-date=May 12, 2018 }}</ref> Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Joe Montana]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[Monica Seles]]) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named [[Official All Star Café]] in April 1996.
